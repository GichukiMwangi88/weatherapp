I want to share with you about a simple web weather app that I created. The app makes use of a free weather API to fetch and display weather data on the page. 

This app was created based on the specifications provided by the Odin Project. My main objective when creating the app was to learn how to use APIs and implement the async/await methods to fetch data. 

To ensure that the app runs smoothly, I also incorporated try-catch methods to catch any errors that may occur.
